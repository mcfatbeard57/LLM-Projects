# Workbooks AI Application
.
Bubble is a full-stack, no-code app builder. You can build scalable applications with this AI-powered no-code development platform. You can also connect your app with ChatGPT or Claude. If you love reading like I do, you may come across countless workbooks. To make sure you ace them, you can stay organized and have them all in one place. Bubble can help you with that by gathering the workbooks listed in your favorite book in one place. This application is powered by the OpenAI API, and everything is done via the UI. Here are the steps to make one for you:

### Step 1: Set the API Connector

#### 1. Install the API Connector

![Alt text](https://github.com/hellotinah/AI-Projects/blob/main/WorkbookAI/Screenshot%20(3).png?raw=true)
    
Make sure to replace `Bearer "YOUR_OPENAI_KEY_KEY"` with your actual OpenAI key. In this particular project, we used one API call, and that is to the Chat Completions Model. It is a POST request, and we are making a POST request to the following URL:         
`https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`. You can change the `max_tokens` variable to make the application more scalable.

![Alt text](https://github.com/hellotinah/AI-Projects/blob/main/WorkbookAI/Screenshot%20(4).png?raw=true)
    
Then click on Reinitialize Call and make sure that the messade_content's type is text.
    
#### 3- Create a new data type:

To store the files that are related to each user, you need to create a new data type.
Navigate through the Data Types and create a new data type called PDFs.

![Alt text](https://github.com/hellotinah/AI-Projects/blob/main/WorkbookAI/Screenshot%20(11).png?raw=true)
    
In the PDFs data type, create the following fields: `PDF` of type `file`, `content` of type `text`, `Full name` of type `text`

![Alt text](https://github.com/hellotinah/AI-Projects/blob/main/WorkbookAI/Screenshot%20(12).png?raw=true)
    
#### 4- Create the Sign-up page:

Because we are using the users data, we need to create the sign-up page to get data from users.
Create a New Page, thne click on Components, then choose the Sign-up Page and drag it into the new page.

This action will add the PDF text to the content field of the PDF.
When sending data to the OpenAI API, consider the number of tokens to reduce cost, you can summarize the PDF text:
Go to Data -> PDFs -> Data Types -> Create a new field called summary and set the type to text.
Add an Action to Summarize the Text Using OpenAI -> Select Plugins -> Choose OpenAI - GPT (ensure the OpenAI and ChatGPT plugin is installed) and Fill in the fields as shown in the image below:

![Alt text](https://github.com/hellotinah/AI-Projects/blob/main/WorkbookAI/Screenshot%20(20).png?raw=true)

#### 7- ChatGPT plugin

Now you can interact with the PDF content and ask questions. But first, let's clean up the UI so that the user can upload multiple PDFs.
First, reset inputs by create another action, then select Elements actions -> Choose Reset inputs.

We can also show a Message When a PDF is Successfully Uploaded:
Go to the Design section -> Drag the Browser plugin into the page (make sure it is already installed) -> Go back to the Workflows section -> Add another action -> Select Element Actions -> Choose Show alert Pop up in Browser -> Write the message you want to display.
    
Now, feed the Knowledge Base to OpenAI:
Add another action -> Select Plugins -> Choose OpenAI - GPT (make sure the OpenAI and ChatGPT plugin is installed) -> Fill in the fields as follows:

#### 8- Display the result

To display the result in the page:
First, go to the Design section -> Add a Text element to the page -> Click outside the page -> Click the "i" icon -> Create a new custom state, call it "result", and set the type to text.

Next, we need to set the Text Element:
Click on the Text element -> In the appearance section, set it to page_name's result.

Finally, set the State in the Workflow Section:

Go to the Workflow section -> Add another action -> Select Element Actions -> Choose Set State and fill in the fields as shown below (replace "storepdfs" with your actual page name):

![Alt text](https://github.com/hellotinah/AI-Projects/blob/main/WorkbookAI/Screenshot%20(22).png?raw=true)

You can be creative and add an input section to ask questions about the workbooks and get answers as well.

# Travel AI Application

This project involves building an AI travel agent that helps you plan your travels based on your preferences.

## Make: Automation Software

Make is a no-code platform that allows you to visualize, create, build, and automate workflows.
This Make scenario is designed to generate a custom travel plan based on a user's interests and then store the generated plan in a Notion database. It connects to OpenAI's GPT-3 and Notion to achieve this. The Basic Repeater ensures the actions are repeated a specified number of times, the OpenAI GPT-3 module generates the travel plan, and the Notion module stores the plan in a database.

# AI Music Generator

The project involves creating music playlists using AI tools. It starts with generating multiple songs on the Udio platform. A script is written to connect the individual songs into a cohesive playlist, which is outputted in MP3 format. Text lyrics, potentially obtained through Whisper-1, are then transformed into prompts that encapsulate the imagery, mood, and vibes of the songs. These prompts are fed into DALL·E to generate corresponding images. Finally, the project combines the playlist with the generated images to create an MP4 file, resulting in a visually beautiful music experience.

To run the project:

* Generate AI music via the Udio platform. You can sign up [here](https://www.udio.com/).
* Open the terminal and navigate to the project folder.
* Download FFmpeg from [here](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases/).
* Add the bin directory inside the extracted FFmpeg folder to your system's PATH environment variable.
* Run the following commands:
     ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    ```sh
    python playlist.py
    ```
    ```sh
    python playlist_images.py
    ```

Make sure to use a valid OpenAI key.

# Video Assistant

This repo contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates simulating video input and audio output against GPT-4o, using OpenAI's API.

## Installation

### ffmpeg

You will need the `ffmpeg` utility installed. Either use the [official installers](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html), or `brew install ffmpeg` (for macOS brew users) or `choco install ffmpeg` (for Windows chocolatey users).

### OpenAI API key

Create a file called `.env` in the root of the project and add the following line:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

If you have an OpenAI account, you can generate an API key from [this page](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

### Python dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Notebook

The simplest and most primitive way to run the demo is to use the Jupyter notebook.

Replace the `input.mov` file with your own recording (or don't) and run the Jupyter notebook called `video-to-speech.ipynb`.

### Running the interactive app

There's also an interactive [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/py/) app that you can run with the following command:

```
shiny run app.py --port 0 --launch-browser
```

Or see a live version at [https://jcheng5.shinyapps.io/multimodal/](https://jcheng5.shinyapps.io/multimodal/).

### Running the bake-off app

Finally, there's a version of the app that you can use to compare GPT-4o with GPT-4 and an open source model called LLaVA:7B. To run it, you'll need to install [ollama](https://ollama.com) and then:

```
ollama pull llava:7b
```
Then run the bake-off app with:
