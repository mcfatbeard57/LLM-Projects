## Audio to Text with Speaker Identification - A FastAPI Project

This project implements an audio-to-text tool built with Python's FastAPI framework. It leverages pre-trained transformers specialized in audio understanding to extract high-accuracy English text from audio recordings. Additionally, the tool identifies individual speakers within the recording, allowing for differentiated transcription.

### Technologies Used

* **FastAPI:** A high-performance web framework for building APIs in Python. It offers a concise and asynchronous approach, making it ideal for this project.
* **Pre-trained Transformers:** Powerful machine learning models trained on vast amounts of audio data. This project utilizes models specifically designed for audio understanding, ensuring accurate transcription.
* **Speaker Diarization:** Techniques to identify and segment speech from different speakers within a recording. This project employs speaker diarization techniques to differentiate between two speakers.

### Project Functionality

The project exposes an API endpoint that accepts audio data as input. This data can be uploaded as a file or streamed in real-time. The API then performs the following steps:

1. **Preprocessing:** The audio data is preprocessed to remove noise and enhance speech signals.
2. **Speech Recognition:** The pre-trained transformer model transcribes the audio into text, capturing the spoken content with high accuracy.
3. **Speaker Diarization:** The audio is analyzed to identify and separate speech segments belonging to different speakers.
4. **Output Generation:** The transcribed text is segmented and attributed to each speaker, resulting in differentiated speaker transcripts.

### Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

* `app`: Contains the FastAPI application code, including API endpoints and helper functions.
* `models`: Houses the pre-trained transformer model and any additional speaker identification models.
* `utils`: Includes utility functions for audio preprocessing and data manipulation.
* `config`: Stores configuration details like supported audio formats and model paths.

### Evaluation and Improvement

**Measuring Accuracy and Similarity:** Evaluating the model's performance is crucial. Standard metrics for speech recognition models include Word Error Rate (WER), Character Error Rate (CER), and Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score. WER measures the number of insertions, substitutions, and deletions needed to correct the transcript. CER focuses on individual characters, while BLEU score compares the n-gram (sequence of n words) overlap between the generated text and a reference transcript. 

**Model Selection:** Choosing the most suitable pre-trained transformer depends on factors like dataset size and desired features. Options include Wav2Vec 2.0, a model specifically trained for audio understanding, and Jukebox, which excels at audio generation and could potentially be adapted for speech recognition. Additionally, speaker diarization models like Diar VAD can be integrated to enhance speaker identification capabilities.

**Noise Reduction Techniques:** Background noise can significantly impact transcription accuracy. Pre-processing techniques like spectral noise subtraction and voice activity detection (VAD) can be implemented to filter out noise and improve speech clarity.

**Real-Time Optimization:** For real-time applications, optimizing the model and processing pipeline is essential. Techniques like model pruning and quantization can reduce the model size and computational cost without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, utilizing hardware acceleration with GPUs or TPUs can further improve processing speed.

### Security and Scalability

**Security Considerations:**  If deployed publicly, security measures are paramount. These include user authentication and authorization to restrict access, data encryption to protect sensitive audio recordings, and regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.

**Scalability for Increased Demand:** As demand for transcription grows, the project needs to scale effectively. Scaling options include horizontal scaling by adding more worker nodes to distribute the processing load and vertical scaling by upgrading hardware resources on existing nodes. Utilizing cloud platforms with auto-scaling capabilities can further streamline the process.

### User Interface

While the report focuses on the API, a user-friendly interface can be developed to allow users to easily upload, transcribe, and manage their audio files. The interface could display speaker-differentiated transcripts, provide options for download or further editing, and offer functionalities like timestamp synchronization with the original audio. 

This project provides a solid foundation for an audio-to-text tool with speaker identification. With further development, it can become a valuable asset for tasks like meeting transcription, audio note taking, and media accessibility.
