# Chatbot-with-Langchain

This repo provides a comprehensive tutorial on building a chatbot using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). It has a step-by-step demonstration of how to build a chatbot using the Langchain library and the OpenAI GPT-3.5 model. We also covers how to use a vector database to store and retrieve relevant information for the chatbot. Finally,we discusses some of the limitations of the RAG approach and provides suggestions for further improvement.

Here are some key points from the video:

* RAG is a technique that can be used to improve the performance of chatbots by allowing them to access and utilize external information sources.
* The Langchain library provides a number of tools and components that can be used to build RAG-based chatbots.
* The OpenAI GPT-3.5 model is a powerful language model that can be used to generate text and translate languages.
* A vector database can be used to store and retrieve relevant information for the chatbot.
* There are some limitations to the RAG approach, such as the need to carefully select and curate the information sources used by the chatbot.
