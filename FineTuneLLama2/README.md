# Fine-tuning LLaMA2 with QLoRA: Chatbot Performance and Efficiency

## Project Summary:

### Feature Description
- **Goal:** Fine-tune LLaMA2, a collection of large language models (LLMs), using the efficient QLoRA technique for enhanced chatbot performance and accessibility.
- **LLaMA2 Models:** 7B to 70B parameters, optimized for chat applications.
- **QLoRA:** Efficient fine-tuning with 4-bit precision, reducing memory usage significantly.
- **Performance:** Achieves state-of-the-art chatbot performance on benchmarks.
- **Open-Source:** All models, code, and resources are readily available.

**Train loss decreases with just 3 epochs and rank = 64** (See Below)
