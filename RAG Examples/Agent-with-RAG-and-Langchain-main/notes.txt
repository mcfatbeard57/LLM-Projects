hello world
Flask Web Dev course

Update __init__.py
Flask-SQLAlchemy 3 no longer accepts an app argument to methods like create_all. Instead, it always requires an active Flask application context. There is no need for that create_database function. SQLAlchemy will already not overwrite an existing file, and the only time the database wouldn't be created is if it raised an error.
