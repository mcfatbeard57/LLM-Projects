# LangChain with OpenAI: Unlocking Powerful Language Applications

This project showcases the capabilities of LangChain, a framework for building creative and interactive language applications, powered by OpenAI's APIs. We explore various functionalities like prompt engineering, chained prompts, specialized agents, and conversation memory to demonstrate the versatility of LangChain.

## Features

- **Prompt Engineering:** Craft tailored prompts for different tasks, leveraging the power of OpenAI's models.
- **Chained Prompts:** Sequence multiple prompts to achieve complex goals or narrative flows.
- **Specialized Agents:** Integrate tools like flight booking, math solver, and Wikipedia search for practical applications.
- **Conversation Memory:** Keep track of past interactions and context for enhanced user experience.
